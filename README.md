# anniversary
A simple calendar for recording date that matters.

At first, I just wanted to configure out how many days I had been with my girlfriend, so I wrote a simple function that did this using JavaScript. Then I thought why can't I present the result on a front page rather than the console. So I made a HTML page containing the JavaScript file. Then, I thought I could add some functions to the page such as recording the meaningful days, important events that we shared together. I want to give it to my girlfriend as a surprise.
I haven't leant CSS before, but I have to use it to make my page looked romantic. After all, It is a useful skill I have to hold soon or later. So you can find a lot of comments in the CSS file. They are my studying trace.
